Adrian's Workshop

Welcome to Adrian's Workshop!

This webpage is aimed at anyone interested in woodwork, and who's not afraid to get covered in saw dust! 
This website should be a go-to for someone struggling with a practical issue or even a technical one, within reason. Above all else, this page should inspire creativity.

The wireframe, which can be found in images/wireframe, I created right at the start of this project is slightly different than what was designed here at the first stage - the reason for this is detailed in the text below. 
This wireframe will still be honoured with the correct technologies, however. To be continued.

Future ideas for this project include a toggle navigation bar for mobile and ipad, as well as for home page across all screen sizes. I tried to implement this with just my current knowledge of HTML/CSS 
but it was proving far too challenging and I would have probably simply copied and pasted someone else's code to achieve it, without knowing how that code is even working. 
I opted instead for a simple icon-only menu bar for mobile and ipad. The home page's (on any screen size) enter button takes you straight 
to the about page. I have hidden the nav menu buttons and all options to use the nav bar and will simply reinstate them, and remove the icon-only menu bar, once I have learned JavaScript/JQuery because my research online 
suggests it may be easier with this technology.

Some page features:
Desktop aside icons dance upon page loads.
Desktop menu and footer items dazzle you when hovered.

Technologies used in this project thus far:
HTML5
CSS3
Bootstrap 4

The following test cases have been performed to test funtionality:
Navigating within pages, using the menu items | Expected behaviour = the different pages loading without new windows/tabs opening | Pass
Changing viewport to landscape | Expected behaviour = content fills the landscape view | Pass
Clicking "Fire Away!" with empty form fields | Expected behaviour = error message | Pass
Hovering anywhere in the desktop menu boxes | Expected behaviour = anchor tag should be clickable anywhere within the idividual boxes | Pass
Clicking the title heading (any screen size) | Expected behaviour = loads home page | Pass


"This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku)."

I used the book "HTML&CSS - design and build websites" by Jon Duckett as a go-to reference if what I was looking for wasn't clear in the modules, on StackOverflow, and/or CSS Tricks 
(these are the main websites I use when struggling with a concept - the latter helped me further understand the concept of relative parents and absolute children).

I drew inspiration from the CSS Tricks website RE spinning icons.
