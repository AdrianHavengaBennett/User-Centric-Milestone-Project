I used the book "HTML&CSS - design and build websites" by Jon Duckett as a go-to reference if what I was looking for wasn't clear in the modules, on StackOverflow, and/or CSS Tricks 
(these are the main websites I use when struggling with a concept - the latter helped me further understand the concept of relative parents and absolute children).

I drew inspiration from the CSS Tricks website RE spinning icons.
