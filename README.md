# Adrian's Workshop

### Welcome to Adrian's Workshop!

This webpage is aimed at anyone interested in woodwork, and who's not afraid to get covered in saw dust! 
This website should be a go-to for someone struggling with a practical issue or even a technical one, within reason. Above all else, this page should inspire creativity.

I used the book "HTML&CSS - design and build websites" by Jon Duckett as a go-to reference if what I was looking for wasn't clear in the modules, on StackOverflow, and/or CSS Tricks 
(these are the main websites I use when struggling with a concept - the latter helped me further understand the concept of relative parents and absolute children).

I drew inspiration from the CSS Tricks website RE spinning icons.
