Welcome to Adrian's Workshop!

This webpage is aimed at anyone interested in woodwork, and who's not afraid to get covered in saw dust!

Future ideas for this project include a toggle navigation bar for mobile and ipad, as well as for home page across all screen sizes. I tried to implement this with just my current knowledge of HTML/CSS 
but it was proving far too challenging and I would have probably simply copied and pasted someone else's code to achieve it, without knowing how that code is even working. I opted instead for a simple icon-only menu bar for mobile and ipad. The home page's (on any screen size) enter button takes you straight 
to the about page. I have hidden the menu buttons and will simply reinstate them, and remove the icon-only menu bar, once I have learned JavaScript/JQuery because my research online suggests it may be easier with this technology.

The following test cases have been performed to test funtionality:

Navigating within pages, using the menu items | Expected behaviour = the different pages loading without new windows/tabs opening | Pass
Changing viewport to landscape | Expected behaviour = content stretches to fill the landscape view | Pass
Clicking "Fire Away!" with empty form fields | Expected behaviour = error message | Pass
Hovering anywhere in the desktop menu boxes | Expected behaviour = anchor tag should be clickable anywhere within the idividual boxes | Pass
Clicking the title heading (any screen size) | Expected behaviour = loads home page | Pass

I used the book "HTML&CSS - design and build websites" by Jon Duckett as a go-to reference if what I was looking for wasn't clear on StackOverflow and/or CSS Tricks 
(these are the main websites I use when struggling with a concept - the latter helped me further understand the concept of relative parents and absolute children).
